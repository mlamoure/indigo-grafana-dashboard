selected it populates the query section at the top.\n * When queries are run, their results are being displayed in the main section.\n * The datasource determines what kind of query editor it brings, and what kind\n * of results viewers it supports. The state is managed entirely in Redux.\n *\n * SPLIT VIEW\n *\n * Explore can have two Explore areas side-by-side. This is handled in `Wrapper.tsx`.\n * Since there can be multiple Explores (e.g., left and right) each action needs\n * the `exploreId` as first parameter so that the reducer knows which Explore state\n * is affected.\n *\n * DATASOURCE REQUESTS\n *\n * A click on Run Query creates transactions for all DataQueries for all expanded\n * result viewers. New runs are discarding previous runs. Upon completion a transaction\n * saves the result. The result viewers construct their data from the currently existing\n * transactions.\n *\n * The result viewers determine some of the query options sent to the datasource, e.g.,\n * `format`, to indicate eventual transformations by the datasources' result transformers.\n */\nexport class Explore extends React.PureComponent<ExploreProps, ExploreState> {\n  el: any;\n  exploreEvents: Emitter;\n\n  constructor(props: ExploreProps) {\n    super(props);\n    this.exploreEvents = new Emitter();\n    this.state = {\n      showRichHistory: false,\n    };\n  }\n\n  componentDidMount() {\n    const {\n      initialized,\n      exploreId,\n      initialDatasource,\n      initialQueries,\n      initialRange,\n      initialUI,\n      originPanelId,\n    } = this.props;\n    const width = this.el ? this.el.offsetWidth : 0;\n\n    // initialize the whole explore first time we mount and if browser history contains a change in datasource\n    if (!initialized) {\n      this.props.initializeExplore(\n        exploreId,\n        initialDatasource,\n        initialQueries,\n        initialRange,\n        width,\n        this.exploreEvents,\n        initialUI,\n        originPanelId\n      );\n    }\n  }\n\n  componentWillUnmount() {\n    this.exploreEvents.removeAllListeners();\n  }\n\n  componentDidUpdate(prevProps: ExploreProps) {\n    this.refreshExplore();\n  }\n\n  getRef = (el: any) => {\n    this.el = el;\n  };\n\n  onChangeTime = (rawRange: RawTimeRange) => {\n    const { updateTimeRange, exploreId } = this.props;\n    updateTimeRange({ exploreId, rawRange });\n  };\n\n  // Use this in help pages to set page to a single query\n  onClickExample = (query: DataQuery) => {\n    this.props.setQueries(this.props.exploreId, [query]);\n  };\n\n  onCellFilterAdded = (filter: FilterItem) => {\n    const { value, key, operator } = filter;\n    if (operator === FILTER_FOR_OPERATOR) {\n      this.onClickFilterLabel(key, value);\n    }\n\n    if (operator === FILTER_OUT_OPERATOR) {\n      this.onClickFilterOutLabel(key, value);\n    }\n  };\n\n  onClickFilterLabel = (key: string, value: string) => {\n    this.onModifyQueries({ type: 'ADD_FILTER', key, value });\n  };\n\n  onClickFilterOutLabel = (key: string, value: string) => {\n    this.onModifyQueries({ type: 'ADD_FILTER_OUT', key, value });\n  };\n\n  onClickAddQueryRowButton = () => {\n    const { exploreId, queryKeys } = this.props;\n    this.props.addQueryRow(exploreId, queryKeys.length);\n  };\n\n  onModifyQueries = (action: any, index?: number) => {\n    const { datasourceInstance } = this.props;\n    if (datasourceInstance?.modifyQuery) {\n      const modifier = (queries: DataQuery, modification: any) =>\n        datasourceInstance.modifyQuery!(queries, modification);\n      this.props.modifyQueries(this.props.exploreId, action, modifier, index);\n    }\n  };\n\n  onResize = (size: { height: number; width: number }) => {\n    this.props.changeSize(this.props.exploreId, size);\n  };\n\n  onStartScanning = () => {\n    // Scanner will trigger a query\n    this.props.scanStart(this.props.exploreId);\n  };\n\n  onStopScanning = () => {\n    this.props.scanStopAction({ exploreId: this.props.exploreId });\n  };\n\n  onToggleGraph = (showingGraph: boolean) => {\n    const { toggleGraph, exploreId } = this.props;\n    toggleGraph(exploreId, showingGraph);\n  };\n\n  onUpdateTimeRange = (absoluteRange: AbsoluteTimeRange) => {\n    const { exploreId, updateTimeRange } = this.props;\n    updateTimeRange({ exploreId, absoluteRange });\n  };\n\n  toggleShowRichHistory = () => {\n    this.setState(state => {\n      return {\n        showRichHistory: !state.showRichHistory,\n      };\n    });\n  };\n\n  refreshExplore = () => {\n    const { exploreId, update } = this.props;\n\n    if (update.queries || update.ui || update.range || update.datasource || update.mode) {\n      this.props.refreshExplore(exploreId);\n    }\n  };\n\n  renderEmptyState = () => {\n    return (\n      <div className=\"explore-container\">\n        <NoDataSourceCallToAction />\n      </div>\n    );\n  };\n\n  render() {\n    const {\n      datasourceInstance,\n      datasourceMissing,\n      exploreId,\n      split,\n      queryKeys,\n      graphResult,\n      loading,\n      absoluteRange,\n      showingGraph,\n      showingTable,\n      timeZone,\n      queryResponse,\n      syncedTimes,\n      isLive,\n      theme,\n      showMetrics,\n      showTable,\n      showLogs,\n      showTrace,\n    } = this.props;\n    const { showRichHistory } = this.state;\n    const exploreClass = split ?
